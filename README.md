ABSTRACT
This project will be based on the safety of the Internet of Things. IoT devices often have very small security mechanisms because their resources are very small. 
So when it comes to communicating with other devices, there is a high probability of cyberattacks, and it is the elevation of today's high-tech IoT that it is necessary to solve this problem.
Digital certificates will be the security mechanism used in the project to validate an IoT device and a server. Furthermore, the revocation of these certificates shall be checked to ensure reliability.
The project will be based on Software defined networks (SDN), which means that the verification of certificates will be done in a programmable switch to prevent the resources of the IoT device from being exhausted.
Thus, the results of the project can be verified that SDN is suitable for working in IoT environments.

Key words: Iot, SDN, security, revocation state, validation, programmable switch.
